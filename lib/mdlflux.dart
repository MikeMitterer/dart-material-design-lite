/// MdlFlux implements unidirectional flow in contrast to popular frameworks such as Angular or Ember.
/// Even though two-directional bindings can be convenient, they come with a cost.
/// It can be hard to deduce what's going on and why.
///
/// When we trigger the action, the dispatcher will get notified.
/// The dispatcher will be able to deal with possible store dependencies.
/// It is possible that certain action needs to happen before another. Dispatcher allows us to achieve this.
///
/// At the simplest level, actions can just pass the message to dispatcher as is.
/// They can also trigger asynchronous queries and hit dispatcher based on the result eventually.
/// This allows us to deal with received data and possible errors.
///
/// Once the dispatcher has dealt with the action, stores that are listening to it get triggered.
/// As a result, it will be able to update its internal state.
/// After doing this it will notify possible listeners of the new state.
///
/// This completes the basic unidirectional, yet linear, process flow of MdlFlux.
/// Usually, though, the unidirectional process has a cyclical flow and it doesn't necessarily end.
/// The following diagram illustrates a more common flow.
///
/// It is the same idea again, but with the addition of a returning cycle.
/// Eventually the components depending our our store data become refreshed through this looping process.
