    <p>The MDL components are created with CSS, Dart, and HTML. You can use the components to construct web pages
        and web apps that are attractive, consistent, and functional. Pages developed with MDL will adhere to modern web
        design principles like browser portability, device independence, and graceful degradation.</p>
    <p>The MDL component library includes new versions of common user interface controls such as buttons, check boxes,
        and text fields, adapted to follow Material Design concepts. The library also includes enhanced and specialized
        features like cards, column layouts, sliders, spinners, tabs, typography, and more.</p>
    <p>MDL is free to download and use, and may be used with or without any build library or development environment.
        It is a cross-browser, cross-OS web developer's toolkit that can be used by anyone who wants to write more
        productive,
        portable, and — most importantly — usable web pages.</p>

    <p>To obtain the components, first, install the <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/mdl"
                                                target="_blank">MDL Package</a>.

    <h4 id="use-the-components">Use the components</h4>
    <p>In general, follow these basic steps to use an MDL component in your HTML page.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with a standard HTML element, such as <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, or <code>
            &lt;ul&gt;</code>, depending on the MDL component you want to use. This establishes the element in the page
            and readies it for MDL modification.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>Add one or more MDL-specific CSS classes to the element, such as <code>mdl-button</code>, <code>mdl-tabs__panel</code>,
            or <code>mdl-list--inline</code>, again depending on the component. The classes apply the MDL enhancements
            to the element and effectively turn it into an MDL component.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>View the page, preferably in multiple browsers on multiple devices, to ensure that the component looks and
            behaves as expected.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>A note about HTML elements and MDL CSS classes</strong><br/>Material Design Lite uses CSS <em>independent
            classes</em>, which can apply to any HTML element, to construct components. For some components, you can use
            almost any element. For other components, some elements give better visual or behavioral performance than
            others. The examples in each component's README file use elements that perform well as that component. If
            you must use elements other than those shown in the examples, we encourage you to experiment to find the
            best combination of HTML elements and MDL CSS classes for your application.</p>

    <p>Detailed instructions for using the components, including MDL classes and their effects, coding considerations,
        and configuration options, can be found in each component's section (on the left). Working examples using
        various options are in each component's demo page or under <a href="/#/samples">"Samples"</a>.</p>
